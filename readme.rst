ProbReg
=======

ProbReg stands for Problem Registration, which is what this tool was originally
developed for. It's actually a port of a mainframe application I built over twenty
years ago after a colleague's design, in which our team meant to keep track of
various issues occurring with the applications we maintained.

When I made the PC version, I added configurable categories and statuses,
and after some time using it for myself I decided I needed some more detailed
progress reporting so I added the rightmost panel.
